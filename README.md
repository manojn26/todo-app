Welcome to the React Simple Todo App! This is a basic todo list application built using React. It allows you to create, mark as done, and delete todos. The app utilizes local storage to save the todo items, ensuring that your todos persist even if you refresh the page or close the browser.

## Features

The React Simple Todo App offers the following features:

1. **Create Todo**: You can add new todos by typing the task description in the input field and pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "Add" button. The todo will be added to the list.

2. **Mark as Done**: Once you have completed a todo, you can mark it as done by clicking the checkbox next to the todo item. The todo will be visually indicated as completed.

3. **Delete Todo**: If you no longer need a todo, you can remove it from the list by clicking the delete button (represented by a trash can icon) next to the todo item.

The React Simple Todo App is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
